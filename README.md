# Jubilant-Guacamole
A Name for my CDN to be used with jsDelivr

# Why?
Well, I did need a type of CDN to use for my projects *(like my [GitHub Sites](https://www.coderninja123.github.io))*, and there was no FREE CDN for use *(nothing is free on the internet)*. Then, after TONS of Googling, I finally found out that jsDelivr solves my problem! The following syntax can be used to access **ANY GITHUB REPO'S FILES:**

```html
<!-- For Stylesheets -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/{user}/{repo}/path/to/css/in/repo.css">

<!--For JS-->
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/{user}/{repo}/path/to/js/in/repo.js">
  // If module, append type="module" in the above line.
</script>
```
